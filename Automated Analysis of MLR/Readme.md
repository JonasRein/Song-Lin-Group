### MLR Modeling.ipynb 
is the Jupyter notebook that was used for all MLR modeling presented in "A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition".

### MLR modeling
Instructions for how to use the notebook (including the statistical analysis of MLR models) is detailed within the notebook. The input files are formated analogous to "Azide IS.xlsx" and other datasets included in the supporting information of the work (see SI3). The file "Azide IS analysis of 119 candidates with R â‰¥ 0.65.xlsx" is a example of a output file. 

#### Please see https://github.com/SigmanGroup for the code used for classification and principal component analysis in this work. The code was used without any modifications aside form trivial modifications e.g., naming of the input files.
