# TetrazoleandAzide

This is a collaborative project between the Lin Group at Cornell University and the Sigman Group at the University of Utah. 

The code in this repository is associated with the following publication "A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition".

This work made use of four tools that were newly developed for this workflow. To facilitate data sorting we implemented counting descriptors to generate a dataset based on substructures in a given molecule. Two new classes of features were developed for this resulting in an automated workflow to extract NBO and Hirshfeld features for statistical modeling of decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity. Further, a human-on-the-loop statistical analysis of MLR forwards selection was implemented into existing MLR modeling infrastructure by Sigman and co-workers.
