# TetrazoleandAzide
This is a collaborative project between the Lin Group at Cornell University and the Sigman Group at the University of Utah. 

The code in this repository is associated with the following publication "A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition". For this work we developed new workflows to extract NBO and Hirshfeld features for statistical modeling of decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity. Further, a human-on-the-loop statistical analysis of MLR forwards selection was developed. 

The some of the code in this repository are modified versions of code that is available form the SigmanGroup (https://github.com/SigmanGroup).
