### Counting Descriptors.py
generates a dataset (example: Dataset with Counting Descriptors.xlsx) based on the presence of substructures in each molecule. The input molecules are specified as SMILES strings in an input Excel file (example: Dataset.xlsx). The substructures are defined in “Descriptor List.xlsx” as SMARTS queries.
